# THIS IS THE UTILS FOLDER

This folder contains all the utility functions that helps the software.
In this case the first function is a python function, that use `Alpha Vantage` api to fetch the stock price data with the input is stock symbol, such as `AAPL`. This function will access to the database and insert directly to the `stockprices` table.

For more details, look up to [Apha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

# Notes !!!!: this function is only use in development phase, used to get some past stock price datas from real world, when in production, the price will be generated by the methods we mentioned in docs/priceSimulationOptions.

Before coming to production (get the database online somewhere) we will use this function to add some real stock prices value, in order to plot/draw some finacial related charts.
And also create an initial state for the app to begin.
